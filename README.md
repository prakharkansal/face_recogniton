# face_recogniton

-this is the code for a face recognition web app 
 
-In align_dlib faces are cropped and aligned using opencv library 
 
-then we preprocess images and use a pretrained tensorflow model to extract the features and obtain a 128 dimensional vector

-then we train a svm classifier on our dataset to recognise faces of different persons.
 
-And our model can detect and recognise multiple faces in an image
